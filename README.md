# Game Engines Project

Name: Sonny O' Mahony

Student Number:  C18317161

Class Group: TU984

# Description of the project
This project is a unique experience, where the user has limited time to explore their current planet before they are brought to a new one.

# Instructions for use
WASD for movement
Shift to run
Space to jump
Mouse to look
R to manually change planet

# How it works
The player can explore a randomly generated planet and scenery within their limited timeframe, when their oxygen runs out a new planet is generated and they start again.
I use recursion for generating the scenery.

# References
I used some material assets from the unity store, WorldMaterialsFree

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am most proud of the unique atmosphere each planet has, done through randomisation of post processing and materials.
